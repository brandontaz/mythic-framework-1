## 📖 Overview

A full-featured in-game admin panel that gives staff the tools to manage players, inspect vehicles, browse the items database, and monitor server activity. Opens as a draggable NUI window with sidebar navigation, dashboard stats, and per-player detail views with moderation actions.

---

> **New Addition:** The admin panel now includes a **Door Lock Tool** and **Elevator Tool** for creating, editing, and deleting doors and elevators at runtime. These tools require `mythic-doors` to be running with database support. Run `/migratedoors` and `/migrateelevators` in-game before using these pages. See the [mythic-doors README](https://github.com/Mythic-Framework/mythic-doors/blob/main/README.md) for details.
